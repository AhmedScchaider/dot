# dotFiles
There are the preferences that I set for a lot of the apps that I use that support it. Mostly it's vim and zsh. Honestly, I have another repository called MacSetup that attempts to automatically install and set up all of these files, along with other MacOS preferences; and installs all of the applications that I use on my system; which I have to figure most people might find more interesting. That repository can be accessed [here](https://github.com/makccr/macSetup) at any time.
