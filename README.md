# Dot Files
These are most of the preferences that I use for command line applications. My preferences are set-up to work primarily on MacOS, but I do occasionally use the same set-up on Manjaro Linux, or a Linux Subsystem on Windows 10. 

Mostly it's preferences for Vim & Zsh, but there are a few other things as well.

### Zsh & my .zprofile
I use the [Powerlevel 10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) for zsh, and I also have made a few, admittedly simple customizations to my .zprofile
